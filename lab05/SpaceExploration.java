Space Exploration Java program
Output a timeline of signigicant space exploration advances
from 2000-2010. Use a random number generator to select
a year within that decade. Then, output all events in the
timeline that have occurred from 2000 up until the year
that has been randomly selected (ex. output all events from 2000
to 2004).
